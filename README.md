# JEDHA_Projet_Kayak

This is a mandatory project for my Data Collection and Management certification:

"As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to:

    -Scrape data from destinations
    -Get weather data from each destination
    -Get hotels' info about each destination
    -Store all the information above in a data lake
    -Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse."

### Prerequisites

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install python-decouple #afin d'avoir les credentials.

### Installation

Once you have the prerequisites, you can run in order:
     - 1_Projet_Kayak_API.py
     - 2_spider.py
     - 3_Visualisation.ipynb

It may take some time to fully run the Python script.
